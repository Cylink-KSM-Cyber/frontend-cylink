# A Brand-New Welcome Experience for New Users

We're excited to introduce a completely rebuilt welcome tour to help new users get started with CyLink. This update focuses on providing a smoother, more intuitive first experience on our platform.

## A Smarter, More Reliable Welcome Tour

We've replaced our old onboarding system with a brand-new, guided tour. It now reliably highlights key features across different pages, like the Dashboard and QR Codes section, ensuring you can discover all that CyLink has to offer without interruption. The tour will now only appear on your very first login for a cleaner experience on subsequent visits.

## Enhanced Account Security and Login Tracking

To support the new welcome experience and improve your account's security, we've enhanced our login system. We now securely track login activity, which helps us protect your account and lays the groundwork for future security features like viewing your own login history.

## Improved API Documentation

For developers using our API, we have updated our technical documentation to be more accurate and easier to use. This ensures that integrating with CyLink is a more straightforward process.
