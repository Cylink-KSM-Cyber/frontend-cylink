# Better Mobile Experience for the Feedback Board

We heard you — using the Feedback Board on mobile felt a bit cramped. So we gave it a refresh!

## What's Changed

- **Bigger, Easier-to-Tap Buttons** — No more accidentally tapping the wrong filter
- **"My Votes" Now Shows Its Label** — Easier to spot and understand at a glance
- **Filters Have Their Own Row** — All, Features, and Bugs now have room to breathe
- **Smoother Scrolling** — Swipe through filter options effortlessly

## Same Great Desktop Experience

Don't worry — if you're on a larger screen, everything looks and works exactly as before.
