# Critical Fix for Link Creation and UI Enhancements

This is an important update that addresses a critical bug preventing the creation of new short links. We have resolved the underlying issue and also added interface improvements to enhance your experience.

## New Link Creation Restored

We identified and fixed a major bug that was causing all new link creation attempts to fail. This was due to a database configuration issue following our last update. The problem is now fully resolved, and the link creation feature is stable and reliable again.

## Real-Time Character Counter for Custom Links

To improve the experience of creating custom links, we have added a live character counter to the input field. You will now see your current character usage (e.g., `15/30`) and receive visual feedback as you type, ensuring you always know how much space you have left.

## Enhanced Platform Monitoring

To improve platform stability and catch potential issues faster, we have integrated the Sentry monitoring system. This allows our team to track errors and performance in real-time, helping us maintain a more robust and reliable service for you.
