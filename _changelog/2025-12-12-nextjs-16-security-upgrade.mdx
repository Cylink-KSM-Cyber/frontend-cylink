# Next.js 16 Security Upgrade

This release delivers a major security upgrade by migrating from Next.js 15 to Next.js 16, addressing critical vulnerabilities that affected Server Components and Server Actions.

## Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### High: Denial of Service with Server Components (GHSA-mwv6-3258-q52c)

- **CVSS Score**: 7.5 (High)
- **Impact**: Attackers could cause service disruption through malformed requests to Server Components
- **Resolution**: Patched in Next.js 16.0.10

### Moderate: Server Actions Source Code Exposure (GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9)

- **CVSS Score**: 5.3 (Moderate)
- **Impact**: Potential exposure of server-side code through Server Actions
- **Resolution**: Patched in Next.js 16.0.10

## What Changed

| Package | Previous | Current |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `next` | 15.5.4 | 16.0.10 |

### Configuration Updates

- **Removed**: `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds` from `next.config.ts` (deprecated in Next.js 16)
- **Updated**: `images.domains` migrated to `images.remotePatterns` (modern API)

## Breaking Changes

None for end users. All configuration changes are internal and backward-compatible.

## Recommendation

Test thoroughly in staging before deploying to production. While this update maintains backward compatibility, the major version upgrade warrants comprehensive testing.
