# Critical Security Updates and Dependency Fixes

We've released an important security update that patches several vulnerabilities in our project dependencies. This release prioritizes the security and stability of the CyLink platform.

## Security Vulnerabilities Addressed

### Critical: Next.js RCE Vulnerability Fixed

We've updated Next.js from version 15.5.4 to 15.5.7, which patches a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the React flight protocol (CVE GHSA-9qr9-h5gf-34mp). This vulnerability had a CVSS score of 10.0 and could potentially allow attackers to execute arbitrary code. **This update is critical for all users.**

### Moderate: js-yaml Prototype Pollution

Fixed prototype pollution vulnerabilities in the js-yaml package used for parsing YAML files. The issue affected the merge operation (<<) and has been resolved by updating to the latest secure version.

### Moderate: mdast-util-to-hast Class Attribute Sanitization

Addressed an unsanitized class attribute vulnerability in mdast-util-to-hast, which is used in our markdown processing pipeline. This ensures better security when rendering user-provided content.

## What Changed

- **Next.js**: Updated from 15.5.4 to 15.5.7
- **js-yaml**: Updated to version 3.14.2+ / 4.1.1+
- **mdast-util-to-hast**: Updated to version 13.2.1+
- All dependency trees have been reviewed and updated to remove vulnerable packages

## Impact on Users

This update is transparent to end users—all functionality remains the same while security is significantly improved. No breaking changes have been introduced.

## Recommendation

We strongly recommend all instances of CyLink to update to this version immediately to ensure maximum security protection.
