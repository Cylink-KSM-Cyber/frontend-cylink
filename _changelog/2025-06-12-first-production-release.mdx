# CyLink v1.0.0: First Production Release

We are thrilled to announce the official launch of CyLink v1.0.0. This is the first production-ready version of our in-house URL shortening and QR code generation platform, designed specifically for the KSM Cyber Security UPNVJ community to provide a secure and branded alternative to public services.

### Comprehensive URL Shortening

You can now transform long links into short, manageable `cylink.id` URLs. The system allows you to add custom titles and set expiration dates, after which links will automatically become inactive. All your links are easily managed from a central dashboard where you can search, filter, and view their status.

### Branded QR Code Generation

Instantly generate QR codes for any of your shortened URLs. Each code can be customized with the official KSM logo and brand colors to maintain a professional look. You can download the final QR codes in high-quality PNG or SVG formats directly from your dashboard.

### Detailed Analytics Dashboard

Understand your audience with our built-in analytics. For each link, you can view detailed statistics on click counts over time, see a geographic breakdown of your visitors, and analyze which devices and browsers are being used to access your content. All data is presented in clear, interactive charts.

### Secure User Management

We've built a secure authentication system to protect your account. This includes a standard registration and login process, along with a secure method for password recovery sent directly to your verified email address. Your dashboard and links are only accessible to you.

### Getting Started

Log in to your new dashboard to start creating your first short URL or QR code. Explore the analytics for your links and see how CyLink can streamline your digital presence.
