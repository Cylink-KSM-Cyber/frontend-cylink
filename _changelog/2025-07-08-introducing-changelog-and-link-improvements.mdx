# Changelog Unveiled & Expanded Link Features

We're excited to roll out version 1.1.0, which brings more transparency to our updates and gives you greater flexibility in creating your links. This release also includes important bug fixes for a smoother experience.

## Stay Updated with Our New Changelog

To make it easier to follow our progress, we've launched a dedicated changelog page. You can now visit `cylink.id/changelog` to see a timeline of all platform updates, from new features to bug fixes, presented in a clear and accessible format.

## More Room for Your Custom Links

You can now create more descriptive and memorable short links. We've increased the character limit for custom backlinks from 10 to 30 characters, giving you more creative freedom while ensuring all your existing links continue to work perfectly.

## Key Fixes and Improvements

### Password Reset Restored

We have resolved a critical issue that prevented the password reset feature from working correctly. You can now reset your password without any issues. The system is now fully functional and secure.

### A Better Mobile Experience

We've addressed several layout problems to improve how CyLink looks and works on mobile devices. This includes fixing the display of long URLs in the QR code window and ensuring pages are easy to read on smaller screens.
