# Smoother Dashboard Search Experience

We've released a small but important update to improve the search functionality on your dashboard.

## Search Bar Input is Now Stable

We fixed an annoying bug where the search bar on the URLs page would clear itself as you were typing. You can now type your search query without the text disappearing, making it much easier and faster to find the links you're looking for. The search will still intelligently wait for you to finish typing before updating the results.

## Technical Clean-up

In addition to the fix, we removed some unnecessary technical logging from the search component. This has no impact on functionality but helps keep our application running smoothly behind the scenes.
