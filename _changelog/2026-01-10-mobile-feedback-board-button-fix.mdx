# Mobile Feedback Board: Even Better on Your Phone

Great news for mobile users! We've squashed a bug that was getting in the way of your feedback experience.

## What We Fixed

On mobile devices, the **Create Feedback** button and the **Menu** button were awkwardly overlapping at the bottom of the screen. Tapping one could accidentally trigger the other — not fun.

Now, both buttons have their own space. The Create Feedback button sits comfortably above the menu button, so you can tap exactly what you mean to tap.

## Keep the Feedback Coming

Love Cylink? Have ideas to make it even better? Found something that's not quite right? Head to the Feedback Board and let us know — your input helps shape what we build next.
